<!-- context7 -->
Use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation whenever the user asks about a library, framework, SDK, API, CLI tool, or cloud service -- even well-known ones like Tailwind or Django. This includes API syntax, configuration, version migration, library-specific debugging, setup instructions, and CLI tool usage. Use even when you think you know the answer -- your training data may not reflect recent changes. Prefer this over web search for library docs.

## Context7 library IDs quick reference:
- Django 6: `/django/django/6_0a1`
- DRF: `/websites/django-rest-framework`
- django-htmx: `/adamchainz/django-htmx`
- Tailwind CSS: `/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com`
- Alpine.js: `/websites/alpinejs_dev`

<!-- serena -->
Use Serena MCP for semantic codebase understanding and symbol-aware code navigation whenever the user asks about an existing project, repository, module, class, function, or implementation detail.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs are tracked in GitHub Issues for `JMZR-SAEP/WMS-SAEP-v2`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the default triage vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, and `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context repo; use root `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` when present, plus the existing repo docs under `docs/` as current domain references. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Project commands

- Run tests: `uv run pytest -q -ra --tb=short --strict-markers --disable-warnings`
> **Nunca utilize redirecionamentos, pipes, `tail`, `head`, `grep` ou truncamento de saída.** Quando houver falha, use o caminho `[full output: ...]` emitido pelo Tee System do RTK para inspecionar a saída bruta completa sem reexecutar o comando.

## Ephemeral development environment

The local environment is disposable in dev.

- the local database may be deleted and recreated;
- the default flow is reset database -> apply migrations -> load minimal data, when available;
- local migrations are unversioned and ignored by `.gitignore`;
- `make init` must be used during the initial project setup to create .venv and install dependencies;
- at this stage of the project, every edit to `models` or schema must be followed by `make setup`, so the workflow does not depend on manual migration management;
- app migrations must be treated as ephemeral artifacts: before testing or completing an implementation that changes the schema, delete and recreate the local migrations from scratch, simulating a clean first execution of the app;
- creating new migration files is not part of the normal delivery in this ephemeral context;
- the source of truth for structural changes is `models`, constraints, indexes, domain rules, and tests; local migrations only materialize the local database;
- tasks without structural changes may follow an incremental flow; a full reset is mandatory only for schema/model changes or when the local environment is inconsistent;

## Language convention

- Source code must use English for models, fields, views, URLs, variables, functions, classes, and internal identifiers.
- Documentation and code comments must use PT-BR.
- Django models must always define `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` in PT-BR.

## Git workflow

- **Never commit directly to main** — always create a feature branch first.
- Confirm the current branch before any commit operation.
- Branch names: `feat/{desc}`, `fix/{desc}`, `refactor/{desc}`, `test/{desc}`, `docs/{desc}`, `chore/{desc}`.
- Commits must be small, cohesive, and reversible — one logical unit per commit.
